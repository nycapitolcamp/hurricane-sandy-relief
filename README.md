hurricane-sandy-relief
======================

<p>
This project was initiated during <a target="_blank"
href="http://capitolcampny.org">CapitolCamp2012</a> which is an annual
“Unconference” and “Hackathon” that brings together government technology
stakeholders from the public and private sectors to discuss how technology can
foster a more transparent, efficient, and participatory government for all New
York State citizens.
</p>

<p>Hurricane-sandy-relief was one of many worked on during the hackathon. You
can find the complete list on the <a target="_blank"

The Problem
-----------

Many New Yorkers are still without use of public utilities and in need of
support in the wake of Hurricane Sandy. On the front page of <a target="_blank"
href="http://governor.ny.gov">http://governor.ny.gov</a> the state has provided
a list of resources for both those that need help, and those who want to help
others. These include topics such as:

<ul>
    <li>How You Can Help Storm Victims</li>
    <li>How to Apply for FEMA Assistance</li>
    <li>Shelters, Warming Centers & Tips for Cold Weather</li>
    <li>Bridges, Subways, Commuter Railways & Roads</li>
    <li>License Extensions, Renewals & Permit Applications</li>
    <li>Environmental Safety Concerns</li>
    <li>SNAP Benefits Replacement & Recertification</li>
    <li>Health</li>
    <li>Insurance</li>
    <li>Avoiding Storm Recovery Scams</li>
    <li>Tax Filing and Payment Deadline Extensions</li>
</ul>

A single page with all of the above topics can be accessed through <a
target="_blank"
href="http://governor.ny.gov/storm-resources">http://governor.ny.gov/storm-resources</a>

After looking at the traffic and analytics of the site, it was clear that the
majority of people browsing the site for storm resources were doing so from a
mobile device. This makes sense considering how much of the public
infrastructure is still recovering.



The Goals
---------

- Aggregate all of the disparate data into one comprehensive data
  source.
- Provide a mobile view of the information from the Governor's website, using
  <a target="_blank" href="http://drupal.org">Drupal</a> as the underlying
  content management system, and
- release the resulting code and data under an Open license.

    structural and stylistic modifications.</li>
</ul>

Here is a screenshot of the mobile site at the end of Day 2 of CapitolCamp.

prospective contributors an idea of where we are headed.
