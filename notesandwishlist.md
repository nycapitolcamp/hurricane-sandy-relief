Application Notes & Wishlist
--------------------


Notes
--------------------
- Tabs are created through Content->Items
- All of them are filtered in a view via taxonomy terms (Tags)
- Create new block views to create new headings with new taxonomy terms.
- Copy over the header text
- Styles are written in SCSS, but can be edited (obviously) in CSS.

Handoff
--------------------

- Update admin permissions to standards
- Make a symlink in the sites/all/data folder to wherever the python script and results live (and run a cron job for it)
- Fill in the rest of content (as needed)
- Test on mobile devices


Wish List
--------------------
- Filter Items along with Links so you don't have to go through to a content page to get there
- Make a separate subtype for a data module to acquire feed data and have the ability to point to different feeds based on fields
- Visualize table data better for mobile consumption
- RSS Feed for the Governers Office Press Releases (lhf)
- Twitter Feeds (lhf)
- Hook the view title to display the output on those views to produce the header like it's shown in place. (lhf)
- Unlink & Download images (lhf)
